# Issue #029: Restructure Module Directory to Comply with MCS Rules

## Priority
ðŸ”´ Critical

## Description
The current module directory structure violates Maysara Code Style (MCS) rules for module organization. Modules are incorrectly nested under `/lib/core/utils/` when they should be direct children of their parent module directory.

## Current Structure (Incorrect)
```
lib/
â”œâ”€â”€ core/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ core.zig
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ problem/
â”‚       â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ problem.zig
â”‚       â”‚   â””â”€â”€ problem.test.zig
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ solver/
â”‚       â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ solver.zig
â”‚       â”‚   â””â”€â”€ solver.test.zig
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ types/
â”‚           â”œâ”€â”€ types.zig
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ types.test.zig
```

## Required Structure (MCS Compliant)
```
lib/
â”œâ”€â”€ core/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ core.zig
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ problem/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ problem.zig
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ problem.test.zig
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ solver/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ solver.zig
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ solver.test.zig
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ types/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ types.zig
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ types.test.zig
```

## MCS Rules Violated
From MCS.md Â§1.1-1.2:
- "Each logical component gets its own directory"
- "Utilities are grouped under a `utils` directory"
- "Complex utilities may have their own subdirectories and submodules"

The current structure treats core modules (problem, solver, types) as utilities when they are actually primary modules.

## Migration Tasks

### 1. Directory Restructuring
- [x] Move `/lib/core/utils/problem/` to `/lib/core/problem/`
- [x] Move `/lib/core/utils/solver/` to `/lib/core/solver/`
- [x] Move `/lib/core/utils/types/` to `/lib/core/types/`
- [x] Remove empty `/lib/core/utils/` directory

### 2. Import Path Updates
Update all import statements:
- [x] In problem.zig: Change `@import("../../../c/utils/glpk/glpk.zig")` to `@import("../../c/utils/glpk/glpk.zig")`
- [x] In problem.zig: Change `@import("../types/types.zig")` to `@import("../types/types.zig")`
- [x] In solver.zig: Update relative imports
- [x] In core.zig: Update module exports

### 3. Test Updates
- [x] Update import paths in all test files
- [x] Verify test discovery in build.zig still works

### 4. Build System Updates
- [x] Update module paths in build.zig if needed
- [x] Verify `zig build` succeeds
- [x] Verify `zig build test` runs all tests

### 5. Documentation Updates
- [x] Update any documentation referencing old paths
- [x] Update file headers with correct paths

## Impact Analysis

### Files Affected
- lib/core/core.zig (module exports)
- lib/core/utils/problem/problem.zig â†’ lib/core/problem/problem.zig
- lib/core/utils/problem/problem.test.zig â†’ lib/core/problem/problem.test.zig
- lib/core/utils/solver/solver.zig â†’ lib/core/solver/solver.zig
- lib/core/utils/solver/solver.test.zig â†’ lib/core/solver/solver.test.zig
- lib/core/utils/types/types.zig â†’ lib/core/types/types.zig
- lib/core/utils/types/types.test.zig â†’ lib/core/types/types.test.zig

### Backwards Compatibility
- This is a breaking change for any code importing these modules
- Since the project is in early development, impact should be minimal

## Testing Requirements
- [x] All existing tests must pass after migration
- [x] Build must succeed without errors
- [x] Verify imports work correctly from lib.zig
- [x] Test that module exports are accessible

## Dependencies
- None - This is a structural refactoring

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Directory structure matches MCS requirements
- [x] All imports updated and working
- [x] All tests passing
- [x] Build system functioning
- [x] No broken references in codebase
- [x] Documentation updated

## Status
âœ… Resolved

## Resolution Summary

### Changes Implemented
Successfully restructured the module directory to comply with MCS rules. All modules have been moved from `/lib/core/utils/` to be direct children of `/lib/core/`.

### Directory Moves Completed
- âœ… Moved `/lib/core/utils/problem/` â†’ `/lib/core/problem/`
- âœ… Moved `/lib/core/utils/solver/` â†’ `/lib/core/solver/`
- âœ… Moved `/lib/core/utils/types/` â†’ `/lib/core/types/`
- âœ… Removed empty `/lib/core/utils/` directory

### Import Updates
- âœ… Updated GLPK imports from `../../../c/utils/glpk/glpk.zig` to `../../c/utils/glpk/glpk.zig`
- âœ… Maintained correct relative imports between modules
- âœ… Updated all test file imports

### Core Module Updates
- âœ… Restructured `/lib/core/core.zig` to export modules directly instead of under `utils`
- âœ… Added proper MCS-style section headers and documentation
- âœ… Updated test imports to reference new locations

### Verification
- âœ… Build completes successfully (`zig build`)
- âœ… All 184 tests pass (`zig build test`)
- âœ… Module exports accessible as `glpk.core.problem`, `glpk.core.solver`, `glpk.core.types`
- âœ… Code follows MCS style with proper section headers and 4-space indentation

### Final Structure
```
lib/
â”œâ”€â”€ core/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ core.zig
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ problem/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ problem.zig
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ problem.test.zig
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ solver/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ solver.zig
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ solver.test.zig
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ types/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ types.zig
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ types.test.zig
```

The codebase now fully complies with MCS directory hierarchy rules, treating problem, solver, and types as primary modules rather than utilities.

## Notes
This issue was identified during Session Review #004 after implementing Issue #006. Resolution completed successfully with all tests passing and full MCS compliance achieved.
