## Description
Establish the complete project directory structure for the GLPK Zig wrapper, following the layout specified in the implementation plan. This includes creating all necessary directories for source code, tests, documentation, and build outputs.

## Requirements

### Directory Structure to Create
```

â”œâ”€â”€ build.zig              # Build configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ build.zig.zon          # Package dependencies

```

### File Creation Requirements
1. Create all directories in the structure above
2. Create placeholder module files with basic structure:
   - Module entry points (`lib.zig`, `c.zig`, `core.zig`)
   - Implementation files (`.zig` files)
   - Test files (`.test.zig` files)
3. Each module file should have:
   - Basic module documentation comment
   - Minimal valid Zig code (can be empty or just comments)
   - Proper file headers if following MCS

### Build Files
- Create `build.zig` with basic project configuration
- Create `build.zig.zon` for dependency management
- Configure library compilation target
- Set up test target configuration

## Implementation Notes
- Use forward-thinking structure that can grow with the project
- Separate C bindings from Zig-native code for clarity
- Keep test files adjacent to implementation files
- Use `utils/` subdirectories for better organization
- The `examples/` directory will be populated in Phase 5
- The `zig-out/` directory is auto-generated by the build system

## Testing Requirements
- Verify all directories are created
- Ensure all placeholder files exist
- Confirm the project structure matches the specification
- Test that `zig build` runs without errors (even if it doesn't do much yet)

## Dependencies
- [#001](001_issue.md) - GLPK must be installed to verify build configuration works

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All directories created according to specification
- [ ] Module entry point files created (`lib.zig`, `c.zig`, `core.zig`)
- [ ] All implementation files created with placeholders
- [ ] All test files created with `.test.zig` suffix
- [ ] `build.zig` created with basic configuration
- [ ] `build.zig.zon` created for package management
- [ ] Project structure follows the planned organization
- [ ] `zig build` command executes without errors
- [ ] Directory listing matches the specification exactly

## Status
âœ… Completed

## Resolution Summary

### Implementation Completed
The complete project directory structure was created during the initial project setup and Issue #001 resolution.

### Delivered Structure
All required directories and files have been created:
- âœ… `build.zig` and `build.zig.zon` configured
- âœ… `lib/` directory with all module files
- âœ… `lib/c/` with C bindings structure
- âœ… `lib/core/` with core module structure
- âœ… All `.zig` and `.test.zig` files in place
- âœ… `docs/` directory with MCS documentation
- âœ… `issues/` directory with tracking system
- âœ… `zig-out/` generated by build system

### Verification
- Project builds successfully with `zig build`
- Tests run with `zig build test`
- All module files are properly structured
- Directory structure matches specification exactly
